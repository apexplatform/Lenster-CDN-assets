    <blockquote>
        When the browser makes a request for a static image and sends cookies together with the request, the server
        doesn't have any use for those cookies. So they only create network traffic for no good reason. You should make
        sure static components are requested with cookie-free requests. Create a subdomain and host all your static
        components there.
        <p>
            If your domain is www.example.org, you can host your static components on static.example.org. However, if
            you've already set cookies on the top-level domain example.org as opposed to www.example.org, then all the
            requests to static.example.org will include those cookies. In this case, you can buy a whole new domain,
            host your static components there, and keep this domain cookie-free. Yahoo! uses yimg.com, YouTube uses
            ytimg.com, Amazon uses images-amazon.com and so on.
        <p>
            Another benefit of hosting static components on a cookie-free domain is that some proxies might refuse to
            cache the components that are requested with cookies. On a related note, if you wonder if you should use
            example.org or www.example.org for your home page, consider the cookie impact. Omitting www leaves you no
            choice but to write cookies to *.example.org, so for performance reasons it's best to use the www subdomain
            and write the cookies to that subdomain.
